# GameDevelopmentSamples
Samples of all chapters in the book `Game Development Programming Foundation`

They are all programmed using `C/C++` language, and built successfully in `Microsoft Visual Studio 2010` using `Win32` framwork.

In some PC that never installed `Visual Studio`, may require Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package which can be downloaded from [here](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5555).

## Usage:

You can open all samples in the `Visual Studio` project named `GameDevelopmentHan`, or you can open them separately from their own folders using `Visual Studio`.

When you use the former method, you should first set a sub-project as the 'StartUp Project'. And then, try to build and debug run it.
